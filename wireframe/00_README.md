Wireframe folder
================

This folder contains wireframe-level screen specifications derived from the UI Design Specification. Files are written for non-technical stakeholders (product, design, client) and describe layout, tokens, and simple ASCII wireframes for quick reference.

Files:
- 01_header.md - Header / Global search band
- 02_product_list.md - Product list main screen wireframe and layout tokens
- 03_product_detail.md - Product detail wireframe outline
- 04_modals.md - Modal sizing and usage (S/M/L) and focus rules

Notes:
- As requested, main layout uses tokens (no absolute px) except for Modal sizes that remain pixel-based.
- The left menu (LNB) is intentionally understated in these wireframes â€” visible but not prominent.
